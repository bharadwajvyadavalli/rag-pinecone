# Large Language Model Project: Advanced LLM with PyTorch and HuggingFace

Welcome to our comprehensive Large Language Model (LLM) project, an endeavor that marks our journey into the fascinating and dynamic world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project embodies our commitment to exploring, building, and refining state-of-the-art language models using the powerful tools provided by PyTorch and the HuggingFace Transformers library.

In recent years, the field of NLP has undergone a significant transformation, primarily due to the advent of sophisticated models like GPT, BERT, and their derivatives. These models have reshaped how we approach tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more, setting new benchmarks in machine understanding of human language.

This project is not just a technical exploration but also an practical project. It aims to demystify the complexities of advanced language models, focusing on the mechanisms that drive these models. By engaging with this project, you'll embark on a path of practical application and innovation, navigating through the intricate details of model architecture, fine-tuning processes, and practical applications.

## Core Components of the Project


### RAGPinecone
Implementation in PyTorch
Throughout the `gpt.py` file, we implement these concepts using PyTorch, a leading deep learning library. PyTorch offers dynamic computation graphs, which are ideal for the iterative and evolving nature of NLP tasks. The script provides a hands-on approach to constructing Attention and Multi-Head Attention layers from the ground up, offering detailed explanations and insights into each step of the process.
